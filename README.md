# Research Projects 

#### [Converted Voice Detection](https://github.com/ciads-ut/converted-voice-detection)

As voice conversion tools improve, generated and authentic voice clips become increasingly indiscernible to the human ear which makes the dissemination of spurious information much more conducive. This project demonstrates an effective approach to converted voice detection. 

#### [Predicting the presence of a Matrix Language in code-switching](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W18-3208)

Researchers of bilingual code-switching often assume that one of the participating languages serves as the ‘base’ or ‘matrix’ into which elements of the other language are embedded. This project explores this phenomena.


# Special Interest Projects 
#### [To Pass or Not To Pass: The Tale of Kobe Bryant](https://github.com/v4lakers/kobe)

![pngpix-com-kobe-bryant-png-transparent-image-500x405](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25602219/44941161-c1d00780-ad5d-11e8-800d-1c36e3947ed2.png)

Kobe Bryant is a retired NBA legend who has had one of the most decorated careers of all time. However, sports pundits have criticized Bryant of taking too many shots and not passing the ball enough. The goal of this study is to discern a relationship, if any, between Kobe Bryant's ball dominant play style and the team's margin of victory.

Countries such as the United States, Great Britain, Germany, and China dominate the medical research world with the plethora of influential Medical Journals present in their respective countries. This project reveals the secret ingridient for a country to be more perverse in the Medical Research world.
