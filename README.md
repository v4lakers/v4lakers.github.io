As voice conversion tools improve, generated and authentic voice clips become increasingly indiscernible to the human ear which makes the dissemination of spurious information much more conducive. This project demonstrates an effective approach to converted voice detection.

### All Things Kobe

#### [Kobe Bryant through a Machine Learning Lens](https://github.com/v4lakers/mlkobe)

Kobe Bryant is without a doubt one of the greatest basketball players we have ever seen. From hitting some of the most improbable shots, to being the leader of 5 NBA championships, Bryant has inspired millions (myself included). This project allows a user to dive deeper into how Bryant played, specifically how he shot the ball. Users can visualize shots Bryant took over his career or build machine learning models to predict the success of Bryant hitting a shot.

#### [To Pass or Not To Pass: The Tale of Kobe Bryant](https://github.com/v4lakers/kobe)

Kobe Bryant is a retired NBA legend who has had one of the most decorated careers of all time. However, sports pundits have criticized Bryant of taking too many shots and not passing the ball enough. The goal of this study is to discern a relationship, if any, between Kobe Bryant's ball dominant play style and the team's margin of victory. 

### [Predicting the presence of a Matrix Language in code-switching](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W18-3208)

Researchers of bilingual code-switching often assume that one of the participating languages serves as the ‘base’ or ‘matrix’ into which elements of the other language are embedded. This project explores this phenomena.

### [First Impression for Dummies](https://github.com/v4lakers/CS329E_team11)

Swipe left… Swipe left… Swipe right… MATCH! With applications such as Tinder, Linkedin, and Facebook, users can form impressions on several people in a short amount of time which has greatly affected the way we date, network, and make friends in the 21st century. According to Anna Pitts of Business Insider, first impressions are made in just 7 seconds. This is precisely the problem we aim to address: How can we determinte the characteristics that help someone nail a first impression? Short answer: Machine Learning

# Special Interest Projects

### [So You Think You Can Get Published?](https://github.com/v4lakers/pubmed)

Countries such as the United States, Great Britain, Germany, and China dominate the medical research world with the plethora of influential Medical Journals present in their respective countries. This project reveals the secret ingridient for a country to be more perverse in the Medical Research world.
